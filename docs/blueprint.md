# **App Name**: Strange Universe

## Core Features:

- 3D Universe Visualization: Display a smooth 3D environment using Three.js, with various universe simulations, such as wormholes.
- Geometry Creation: Enable the creation and placement of basic geometric shapes within the simulated universe.
- Spectator Controls: Provide controls to allow the user to look around the simulated universe from a fixed spectator position.
- Realtime Configuration: Allow users to update universe properties in real-time through a configuration interface.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of mystery and the unknown.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222) to allow the 3D environment to stand out.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#BF00FF) for interactive elements and highlights, creating contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, providing a clean and modern look for UI elements.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro', a monospace font, is used only to show snippets of Three.js code to assist users or customize the geometries if advanced Three.js usage is intended.
- Use a minimalistic layout to emphasize the 3D environment, with unobtrusive UI elements.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance the feeling of moving through connected spaces.
